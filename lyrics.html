        Fly me to the moon
        Let me play among the stars
        Let me see what spring is like on
        A-Jupiter and Mars
        In other words, hold my hand

        In other words, baby, kiss me

        Fill my heart with song and let me sing forevermore
        You are all I long for
        All I worship and adore
        In other words, please be true

        In other words, I love you
        Fill my heart with song
        Let me sing forevermore
        You are all I long for, all I worship and adore
        In other words, please be true
        
        In other words
        In other words
        I love you
